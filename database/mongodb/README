A simple python script that shells out key metrics from mongodb to gmetric.
Right now it tracks the following:

* Operations per second
* Memory usage
* Btree statistics
* Master/Slave status
* Current connections
* Database sizes (if pymongo is available)

It is intended to be run every minute as a cron.

Thanks!
