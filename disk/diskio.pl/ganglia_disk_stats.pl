# 4 -> reads, 8 -> writes, 12 -> ios IO requests waiting
# If you would like some of the other stats append them

# This is the order of metrics in /proc/diskstats

# 1 minor         Minor number
# 2 blocks        Blocks
# 3 name          Name
# 4 reads         This is the total number of reads completed successfully.
# 5 merge_read    Reads and writes which are adjacent to each other may be merged for
#               efficiency.  Thus two 4K reads may become one 8K read before it is
#               ultimately handed to the disk, and so it will be counted (and queued)
#               as only one I/O.  This field lets you know how often this was done.
# 6 s_read        This is the total number of sectors read successfully.
# 7 ms_read       This is the total number of milliseconds spent by all reads.
# 8 writes        This is the total number of writes completed successfully.
# 9 merge_write   Reads and writes which are adjacent to each other may be merged for
#               efficiency.  Thus two 4K reads may become one 8K read before it is
#               ultimately handed to the disk, and so it will be counted (and queued)
#               as only one I/O.  This field lets you know how often this was done.
# 10 s_write       This is the total number of sectors written successfully.
# 11 ms_write      This is the total number of milliseconds spent by all writes.
# 12 ios           The only field that should go to zero. Incremented as requests are
#               given to appropriate request_queue_t and decremented as they finish.
# 13 ms_io         This field is increases so long as field 9 is nonzero.
# 14 ms_weighted   This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O completion, I/O
