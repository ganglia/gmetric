This script should be called by cron once every minute.

You may have to tweak some variables:
* location of the gmond.conf file
* whether your version of gmetric supports the group flag (>3.1 IIRC)
* the location of the rec_control binary (for talking to the pdns_recursor process)

Feedback to ben@hartshorne.net welcome, or find me in #ganglia in IRC on Freenode.
